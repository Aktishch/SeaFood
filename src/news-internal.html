    The plenary session, the main event of the business programme, was dedicated to the concept of ‘Smart Fishing’. Federal Agency for Fisheries Director Ilya Shestakov read out a welcome address to the participants from Russian Federation Council Chairwoman Valentina Matviyenko and stressed that the primary goal of the Forum is to provide a meaningful, multilateral approach to the integrated development of the fisheries industry, taking into account different economic, social, environmental, and scientific aspects. The ongoing changes in the global economy, the geographical segmentation of the market, the extension of supply chains affect the pricing and availability of fish. In addition to new challenges, the importance of environmental management continues to grow, as Russia adheres to the principles of sustainable fishing, while focusing on scientific data, actively promoting the sustainable use of aquatic biological resources, and introducing innovations in shipbuilding and fish processing.

    In his welcome address, Russian Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev underscored the event’s importance for strengthening cooperation and making optimal decisions about measures to regulate and support the industry. Such decisions include developing fishing industry science, building new research vessels, providing assistance in the transportation of fish products, and other support measures for fishing and fish processing companies in the form of subsidies and investments in new production facilities. The Ministry of Agriculture reports that nine new specialized fish feed production plants with capacity of more than 220,000 tonnes per year will be commissioned in Russia over the next five years. The goal has been set that domestically produced feed will cover all the demands of fish farmers for this product by 2030. Russian Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade and State Secretary Viktor Yevtukhov noted the importance of Russia’s technological sovereignty in the production of fish processing and ship equipment. He also said it would be ill-advised to reject cooperation with other countries and pointed out the need for state support and a feasibility study. Kamchatka Territory Governor Vladimir Solodov said the industry needs to produce a greater economic return to the development of his region and that local fish processing enterprises are implementing several projects as part of the investment quota programme. At present, seven of the eight projected plants have already been built in Kamchatka and thousands of jobs have been created. In addition, major fishing clusters are being built in the region and are already engaged in the waste-free processing of aquatic biological resources.
